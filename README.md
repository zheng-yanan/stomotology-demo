## A Demo for Intelligently Diagnosing Stomatological Diseases


This is a demo for diagnosing stomatological diseases in an intelligent question-answering manner.
It implements a ontology-based intelligent system especially for guiding the diagnosis of oral
diseases. 
The system has been online tested via the public WeChat official account of Peking University
School of Stomatology.

### Introduction
This work highlights in three aspects. 
First it develop efficient and fast approach to extract useful information from raw medical data. 
Second the released stomatological ontology will further facilitate the knowledge engineering and intelligent applications in this field. 
Third I adaptively improve related state tracking algorithms as well as learned policies, which demonstrate an example for applying question answering in medical field.


### Datasets
It is based on real-world medical records from Peking University Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing, China.
